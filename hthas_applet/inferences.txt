We need to distinguish the event from the timeline in order to catalog our history.
Remembering the past elicits fear of repetition.
Any singular piece of knowledge is determined by many avenues of inquiry.
Our tools for discovering facts and poetics represent the potential of suggestion rather than the potential of certainty.
To start is to start over.
Our eyes are only as intelligent as our way of looking.
When we perceive time as measured,time is differentiated.
We hold our histories and history holds us.
The mind generates its own assumptions.
Serious shit comes up at night.
We tend to believe that helps agency originates outside the self.
Space protects information; time retrieves clarity.
